# disney-react
A simple React front-end for creating movie character ideas. I ran out of time before I could finish it, but the idea is just to demonstrate a React front-end hitting a Node API, which queries a Postgres database. This and the corresponding API are things I tried to quickly code up the morning of my interview, so they're far from production grade polish (not linted, not using env variables, etc.). The avatars are customizable with many options, though I didn't get a chance to create the edit page.
